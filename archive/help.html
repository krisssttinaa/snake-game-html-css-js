            <br>
            1. The player controls the white snake, whose food are crystals ONLY, on the game board (use the arrow keys.)
            <br><br>
            2. The snake starts with a length of 4 and a default direction.
            <br><br>
            3. Each time the snake eats crystal, its length increases by 1 and a new crystal is randomly placed on the board.
            <br><br>
            4. If the snake collides with the walls or its own body, the game is over and the player loses.
            <br><br>
            5. The player's score is based on the number of crystals the snake eats.
            <br><br>
            6. The idea is to eat crystals without colliding with the walls, the stones-obstacles or the snake's own body.
            <br><br>
            7. The goal is to reach the number of generated crystals (based on the level of difficulty that you have chosen).
            <!--<br><br>
            8. The first game is by default - in easy mode.-->
            <br><br>
            Good luck! :)</p>
